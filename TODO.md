TO DOs:
- Gridlike map
	- Motivation:
		- facilitate collision detection (semi-true)
		- facilitate pathfinding
		- facilitate building (questionable)
- Collision detection based on grid at first, maybe improve later to only use grid for optimization (searching for obstacles)
- Dumb straight path enemies
- Shooting mechanics
- Waves
- Animation
- Smart pathfinding for enemies
- Map editor mode
- Field of view for player
- Friendly NPCs
- Building
- NPCs can build too
- Different weapons and acessories (grenades, mines, lasers, c4, etc)
- Economy
- Field of view for enemies (do we really need this? may not be good for gameplay, test it!)

CONSIDER:
- move camera independent of player
