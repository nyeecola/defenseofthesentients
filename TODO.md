TO DOs:
- Gridlike map
	- Motivation:
		- facilitate collision detection (semi-true)
		- facilitate pathfinding
		- facilitate building (questionable)
- Collision detection based on grid at first, maybe improve later to only use grid for optimization (searching for obstacles)
- Dumb straight path enemies
- Shooting mechanics
- Waves
- Animation
- Smart pathfinding for enemies
- Map editor mode
- Field of view for player
- Friendly NPCs
- Building
- NPCs can build too
- Different weapons and acessories (grenades, mines, lasers, c4, etc)
- Economy
- Field of view for enemies (do we really need this? may not be good for gameplay, test it!)

CONSIDER:
- move camera independent of player

New TODOs:
- render model loaded with assimp without animations
- render model loaded with assimp with animations
- add obstacles without collision
- add shadows
- add collision
- instanced rendering with tons of enemies
- make enemies move
- make enemies killable
- add NPCs
- add ragdolls
- add SSAO
- add building with grid (or perhaps just item placement, not fully-buildable scenario)
